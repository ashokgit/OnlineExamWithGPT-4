## Because, Why the F\*\*\* Not?

While online exams serve as an essential tool for assessing candidates' knowledge and skills, the rapid advancements in AI technologies, like OpenAI's GPT models, challenge the traditional examination methods. This project serves as a thought-provoking reminder that the examination systems must evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of technology.

The Online Exam Cracker is a fun and experimental project that demonstrates the capabilities of AI in understanding and solving exam questions. It is an open invitation for educators, researchers, and developers to rethink the future of assessments and explore innovative ways to test candidates without relying solely on conventional methods.

By open-sourcing this project, we encourage the community to contribute their ideas, enhancements, and suggestions to improve the tool further. Let's collaborate and drive the conversation around reimagining the examination systems of the future. Together, we can engineer a better and more comprehensive approach to assessing knowledge and skills in the age of AI.
